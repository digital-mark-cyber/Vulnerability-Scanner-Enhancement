# Vulnerability-Scanner-Enhancement - An Open-Source Initiative


Improving vulnerability scanner performance is essential for businesses looking to strengthen their security stance. Vulnerability scanners probe networks, systems, and applications for known vulnerabilities to help find weak points inside a system. Even if they work well, many widely used scanners have issues with poor performance and high false-positive rates, especially when scanning vast spaces. In this article, we'll look at how to maximize vulnerability scanners' performance and lower the number of false positives.

## Knowing How to Use Vulnerability Scanners
Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS, and Burp Suite are a few examples of vulnerability scanners that automate the identification of known vulnerabilities in various systems. They employ large vulnerability databases, such as CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), to compare against setups and software currently operating in an environment.
Nevertheless, these scanners may produce many false positives—vulnerabilities reported that are neither pertinent nor actionable. Furthermore, scanning performance may degrade depending on the size of the infrastructure, which could cause reporting delays.

The effort to improve a vulnerability scanner centers on two main areas to address these problems:

## Reducing  False Positives

**Contextual Filtering**: Vulnerability scanners occasionally lack context regarding the scanning environment. By creating a context-aware module, you can weed out vulnerabilities that don't apply, including those for services that aren't in use or improperly set detection logic.


**Customized Rulesets**: Developing unique rules according to the particular situation can help reduce false positives even more. One way to assist would be to exclude specific services considered unnecessary for the scan.


**Integration of Machine Learning**: Machine learning models can help decrease false positives by examining historical data and determining which outcomes were previously flagged as false positives. Using actual data to train the model can predict and filter out false alarms.


## Enhancing the Performance of Scanning
**Simultaneous Processing**: Applying parallelized scanning in situations where various network segments or systems are simultaneously scanned, which can significantly expedite the procedure. Methods such as distributed scanning or multi-threading can be used. Use incremental scanning instead of complete scans every time. This method lowers the overall burden by concentrating only on changes since the last scan.


**Selective Deep Scanning**: Use a tiered strategy that begins with shallow scans and progresses to deep scans only on systems where shallow scans identify possible vulnerabilities. This eliminates the need to perform complete, deep scans of every system.


For instance, improving the OpenVAS Scanner.
OpenVAS, an open-source vulnerability scanner, offers a robust and feature-rich solution for network vulnerability testing. Here's an example of how some improvements can increase OpenVAS's effectiveness.

**1. Cutting Down on False Positives Putting Contextual Filtering in Place**

Contextual filters can be added to OpenVAS by using NASL (Nessus Attack Scripting Language) to write custom scripts. To disregard unnecessary vulnerabilities, for example:

![pic001 vulnerability scanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/149e8462-7295-480b-9832-62b95d6a9cfb)



This logic ensures that only services matching specific criteria are scanned, reducing unnecessary alerts.




**2. Personalized Rulesets**
Custom rules can be defined in OpenVAS according to the scanning profile. Certain CVEs with no bearing on the targeted system can be excluded using these profiles. This is an illustration of an exclusion file:

![pic01 vulnerability scanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b04f18e-d28e-4445-a951-3145fe0f030c)



This exclusion guarantees that vulnerabilities that were identified during prior scans but judged insignificant will not surface again.




**3. Enhancing Performance with Parallel Processing**
Multi-threading can be used to improve performance in the context of OpenVAS. OpenVAS Manager can programmed to divide scanning tasks across several threads:

![pic002 vulnerability scanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f32310ba-1b6c-4475-ad2b-bc5a0ab324ad)


This command allows OpenVAS to perform concurrent scans, reducing the overall time taken for large-scale network assessments.



**4. Incremental Scanning**
We can improve speed significantly by configuring OpenVAS to run incremental scans based on the last scan state. This ensures that only systems with changes are rescanned:

### Broad Example: Building a Custom Rule for False Positive Reduction
Here's a sample Python script to filter scan results and reduce false positives by cross-referencing
vulnerabilities with system configuration data.

![pic 03 vulne scanner ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1ace73-af27-404f-be99-c4fd265ef2e9)

This script cross-checks vulnerabilities found in a scan with known system configurations, helping to
ignore false positives. 


More accurate results can be obtained by lowering false positives and maximizing functionality. Enhancements such as incremental scanning, custom rulesets, and contextual filtering allow you to maximize the scanner's usefulness while reducing needless alarms and resource usage. Security teams can maintain a leaner, faster, and more dependable security posture by implementing these improvements to an open-source solution such as OpenVAS.
